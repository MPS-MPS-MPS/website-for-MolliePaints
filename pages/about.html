    <p>
        <strong>Mollie Wilson</strong> is a Melbourne based abstract 
        painter who focuses on the <strong>human body</strong>, in 
        distorted, yet recognisable forms. Familiar anatomical structures, 
        in the process of movement, are used as the 
        basis for abstraction. Mollie is particularly interested in the 
        agitated, <strong>primal movements</strong> found in dancing and 
        fighting. Mollie interrogates physical appearance to uncover an 
        underlying and <strong>unconscious presence</strong>, and through this interrogation,
         retrieves appearance back to its <strong>physicality</strong>. 
         Mollie's painting process, much like the human experience, 
         begins and ends with the physical body.
